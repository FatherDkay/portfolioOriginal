                <p>Hello and welcome to my online portfolio!  This is a work and progress with content becoming more avaiable as I continue my education in full stack development.  Completing my training as a full stack developer will be a dream come true as I have a life long passion for creativity, technology, and helping others.</p>

            <div class="hero-right">
                <p>For the last 12 years I have served the special needs community.  I started as an aide in a classroom working with students with behavioral challenges.  Once I completed my masters in special education I became a transition teacher, working with moderate/severe students ages 18-22.  Eventually I moved from the classroom into an administrative role as the director of special education for 2 different non-public schools. Prior to my work in special education I earned a bachalors in business and worked mostly in sales.  In my free time I enjoy various hobbies.  I am a woodworker and a musician plying both drums and piano.  I am also an avid fan of themeparks frequenting many of the parks available here in Southern California.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Access:  Prior to enrolling in the UCLA bootcamp I developed Access Database systems for both my previous and current schools.  It was this project that opened my eyes to what a challenging and rewarding process softwrae development can be.  My most recent system has proven very successful in helping with many education areas such as student data, report cards, attendance, and more.</p>
